# Summary : This Script first goes to the specified webpage to take the list of colleges
#           and it iteratively goes into every website and extracts the name , address ,
#           phone number , email id ( if available) , and weblink and puts it into a csv
#           file as an output
#..........................................................................................
#url is a list which contains all the urls to get lists of colleges from
urls = []
urls.append("https://collegedunia.com/science/visakhapatnam-colleges")
urls.append("https://collegedunia.com/education/visakhapatnam-colleges")
#state has to be explicitly specified to print in the csv file
state = "Andhra Pradesh"
#how many time chrome has to scrool down in the page to get the full list as the page is dynamicaly loaded
no_of_pagedowns = 100

#Extracting Data from Website
#BeautifulSoup to extract contents from the website.
#requests

#Scrolling through the page dynamically
#selenium for using the chrome webdriver
#time to wait for a while and scroll down the page
#### Also Needs Chrome Driver to be explicitely installed to work with dynamicaly scrolling down pages ###
